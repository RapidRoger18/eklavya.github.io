### Project Description
The morphable multi-terrain robot, known as EvoBorne, under development by SRA, is capable of navigating both airspace and landspace in its drone mode and quadruped version.
<br>
With two wheels and two thrusters, this project seeks to develop a MPC(Model Predictive Control) that can equip the bot with autonomous self-balancing so that it can maneuver through steep terrain in a semi-drone mode. To fully automate the robot to navigate all terrains using SLAM and trajectory planning, a semi-drone mode would be essential.
